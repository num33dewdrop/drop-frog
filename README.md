## Overview
drop-frog is a code for a community site where various budding creators can exhibit their works and have them evaluated!

*Want to find new insights by exhibiting and evaluating your own work*

*Want to be exposed to works in a variety of fields*

*Want to experience works in a variety of fields.*

We created this site in the hope that it will become a place of relaxation for such novice creators.

And this site is also an inexperienced code that the author created in full scratch for practice after one year of learning from no experience.

Here is the actual site.
https://drop-frog.com/

If anyone is interested in this repository, please feel free to give us your feedback through issues, pull requests, or comments.
We look forward to working with you toward the outcome of this project.

Best regards.
